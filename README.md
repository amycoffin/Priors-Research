builtParsing.py holds functions, many of which are old and not relevant to the blacklisted priors 
parseBuilt.py creates discordantCases.py, which contains data objects that correspond to the 14 "cases" of priors found in the blacklist
A case is defined as priors that all have the same discordance, i.e. "seans = 0.3 and ours = 0.03"
There are 14 cases overall, and are numbered 1-14
